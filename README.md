# Project Title: Book Startup Market Analysis & Data-Driven Insights

**Overview:** This project involves analyzing a database of books, authors, publishers, customer ratings, and reviews to generate a value proposition for a book startup. The goal is to understand key market trends, identify top-performing books and authors, and make data-driven recommendations for improving the startupâ€™s competitiveness. Using SQL queries and Python for data analysis, the project provides deep insights into book ratings, reviews, and publishing trends.
